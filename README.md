📊 Data Analytics Project – End-to-End Analysis & Dashboard
Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, starting from raw data ingestion to delivering business insights through an interactive dashboard and presentation.
The goal is to analyze customer/business data, identify key trends and patterns, and communicate insights effectively using visualization and reporting tools.

📁 Dataset:

Source: CSV dataset (structured data)

Content: Contains customer, transaction, and behavioral attributes

Size: Medium-scale dataset suitable for analytics and visualization

Format: .csv

The dataset is loaded into Python for analysis and into relational databases for SQL querying.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Programming: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Database: PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server

SQL: Data querying, joins, aggregations, filtering

Visualization: Power BI

Reporting: PDF / DOC report

Presentation: Gamma (AI-powered PPT creation)

IDE: VS Code / Jupyter Notebook
